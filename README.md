Angular Components are fundamental building blocks in Angular applications. They encapsulate a piece of the user interface, including its template, styles, and logic. Each component defines
a reusable piece of functionality that can be used multiple times within an Angular application.

Key functionalities of Angular components:

Template: Defines the HTML structure of the component's view.
Styles: Contains CSS styles that apply to the component's elements.
Logic: Implements the component's behavior and interactions with other parts of the application.
Data binding: Enables communication between the component's template and its logic.
Directives: Allows for custom behavior to be added to elements within the template.
Services: Can be used to share data and logic between components.
